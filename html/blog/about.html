    <h1>My Sporty blog</h1>
    <p>My name is Ida, and I have been doing a lot of sports throughout my life. I started with football in the age of 6, and that's the sport that I'm still doing seriously.</p>
    <p>Other than football I've also tried cross country skiing and floorball on a serious level.</p>
    <p>I've also tried and still doing a lot of sports just for fun: 
        <ul>
            <li>climbing</li>
            <li>running</li>
            <li>cycling</li>
            <li>swimming</li>
            <li>rollerski</li>
            <li>downhill skiing</li>
            <li>and much more</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Besides doing sports myself, I just love watching almost all kinds of sports, both live and on the television. I might be called a sports freak, but I'm fully ok to live with that title.</p>
